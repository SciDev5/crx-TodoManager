# Contributing

If you want to contribute, please stick to the style which is already present
in the repo. This means:
- 4 spaces for tabs
- double quotes
- full jsdoc typings
- omit one-line block curlys
- use semicolons
- one scss file applies to group of related elements in the same folder and subfolders
- code must work before it is merged back in
- keep look and feel of css consistent
- don't mix react and other code too much
- code is reasonably documented

Contact me if there are any questions.
